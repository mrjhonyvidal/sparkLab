## INTRODUCTION

Linear Regression models are used to predict variables, like: the price of a house, the size in centimeters of something, how much something cost.

Topics to have in mind when working with Linear Regression models:
- MAE: Mean Absolute Error
- MSE: Mean Squared Error
- RMSE: Root Means Square Error

For work with Spark ML, we will need a sample data that contains:
- a label, for regression number is only a number
- features, which is a vector, in the example below we have a label with 10 features per line.
